      <description>Hey We are now one week into 2021. Among all the festivities, celebrations, and general newness in my life, I&amp;rsquo;m reminded to take some time to write down my intentions.
This follows what has been a notable year to most, including myself.
In Retrospect Looking back, 2020 did not live up to my expectations (to no one&amp;rsquo;s surprise), though it was not all bad. I would qualify this past year as passive, if I were to choose a single word for it.</description>
